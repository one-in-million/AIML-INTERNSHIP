# 🛳️ Titanic Data Preprocessing

This project focuses on **data preprocessing** of the Titanic dataset. The goal is to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for further machine learning tasks such as classification and survival prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner datasets used in machine learning. It contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.  

This notebook (`titanic.ipynb`) demonstrates the step-by-step process of:
- Importing and understanding the dataset  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling and transformation  
- Preparing the data for modeling

## 📊 Key Steps in Preprocessing

* **Importing libraries**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Handling missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked, etc.)**
* **Encoding categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Pclass, etc.)**
* **Feature scaling & normalization**
* **Splitting data into training/testing sets**

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Apply machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
* Optimize hyperparameters
* Evaluate survival prediction accuracy
